This is a repo used to demonstrate how to solve a merge conflict when it occurs with your teammates. Sometimes, Github is smart enought to fix the conflicts but in most other cases, human intervention is required. 

Merge conflicts are a very common part of working with GitHub. Do not fear the conflicts, my friends! Fear only the dark. 

King for a Day - Pierce the Veil
Please, won't you push me for the last time?
Let's screm until there's ntohing left
So sick of playing, I don't want this anymore
The thought of you's no fucking fun
you want a martyr? I'll be one
Because enough's enough we're done
you told me "think about it", well I did
