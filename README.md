This is a repo that is used, to demonstrate how to solve a merge conflict when it occurs with your teammates. Sometimes Github will automatically solve the issue, other times it cannot and requires human intervention.

Merge conflicts are a common part of working with GitHub. Do not fear the conflicts, my friends! All will be well.
