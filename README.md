###Merge Conflicts, don't fear them.

This is a repo that is used, in class, to demonstrate how to solve a merge conflict when it occurs with your teammates. Sometimes Github will automatically solve the issue, other times it cannot and requires human intervention.

Merge conflicts are a common part of working with GitHub. Do not fear the conflicts, my friends! All will be well. W will solve the issues!

This is extra more content that thatb I added through GitHub Desktop. I am causing a merge conflict on purpose.
